# **Automatic Text Summarization Project**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all implementations for extractive and abstractive text summarization models. The code is structured in a **Jupyter Notebook (`Final_Project.ipynb`)**, where all analyses, training, evaluations, and visualizations are performed.

## **Files**
- **`Final_Project.ipynb`** – The main notebook containing the full implementation.
- **`Distribution of Article and Summary Lengths.png`** – Visual analysis of dataset statistics.
- **`Lexical Overlap Analysis.png`** – Comparison of lexical similarity between articles and summaries.
- **`Summarization Performance Trends.png`** – Performance trends across different summarization models.

## **Usage**
Simply open and run `Final_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to execute all experiments and generate outputs.
